## 🔴 Critical Backend Gaps

### 1. Missing Database Models
- ❌ **Waste Model** - Required for FR-3.3 (Waste Tracking)
- ❌ **Sustainability Metrics Model** - Required for FR-7.1, FR-7.4 (Scoring, Carbon Footprint)
- ❌ **Notifications Model** - Required for FR-9.1, FR-9.2 (Push/In-App Notifications)
- ❌ **AI Predictions Model** - Required for storing ML predictions
- ❌ **Analytics/Reports Model** - For caching complex analytics

### 2. Missing Services
- ❌ **Sustainability Service** - Calculate scores, carbon footprint, recommendations
- ❌ **Notification Service** - Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- ❌ **Analytics Service** - Complex data aggregation and reporting
- ❌ **ML Prediction Service** - Progress prediction, budget allocation AI
- ⚠️ **Cost Prediction** - Partially implemented in gemini.service.js but not fully integrated

### 3. Missing Controllers
- ❌ **Sustainability Controller** - `/api/sustainability/*` endpoints
- ❌ **Notifications Controller** - `/api/notifications/*` endpoints
- ❌ **Analytics Controller** - `/api/analytics/*` endpoints
- ❌ **Reports Controller** - `/api/reports/*` endpoints
- ❌ **AI Controller** - `/api/ai/*` endpoints (material estimation, cost prediction)

### 4. Missing API Routes
According to requirements (Section 5.1), missing endpoints:
- ❌ `POST /api/ai/estimate-materials`
- ❌ `POST /api/ai/predict-costs`
- ❌ `POST /api/ai/predict-completion`
- ❌ `POST /api/ai/extract-tasks`
- ❌ `POST /api/ai/ocr`
- ❌ `GET /api/projects/:id/analytics/progress`
- ❌ `GET /api/projects/:id/analytics/sustainability`
- ❌ `GET /api/projects/:id/analytics/materials`
- ❌ `POST /api/projects/:id/reports/status`
- ❌ `POST /api/projects/:id/reports/expenses`

### 5. Incomplete Implementations
- ⚠️ **Material Usage Logging** - No API endpoint for POST /api/materials/:id/usage
- ⚠️ **Task Photo Upload** - Endpoint missing for POST /api/tasks/:id/photos
- ⚠️ **Time Logging** - Endpoint missing for POST /api/tasks/:id/time
- ⚠️ **Document OCR** - Gemini service has method but no controller/route
- ⚠️ **Weather Integration** - Service exists but not exposed via dashboard controller

## 🟡 Frontend Gaps

### 1. UI Implementation Issues
- ⚠️ **Dashboard uses random data** - Not connected to real backend API
- ❌ **No Sustainability Dashboard UI** - Required by FR-7.1, FR-7.3
- ❌ **No AI Material Estimation UI** - Required by FR-3.5
- ❌ **No Carbon Footprint Display** - Required by FR-7.4
- ❌ **No Waste Tracking UI** - Required by FR-3.4

### 2. Missing Features
- ❌ **Offline Mode** - FR-8.1 requires SQLite caching, not implemented
- ❌ **Push Notifications** - Firebase Cloud Messaging not integrated
- ❌ **Charts with Real Data** - Dashboard charts use random data
- ❌ **Weather Widget** - Component exists but not integrated
- ❌ **Gantt Chart View** - Required by FR-4.7

### 3. UX Improvements Needed
- ⚠️ **Loading States** - Inconsistent across app
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** - No standardized error UI
- ⚠️ **Empty States** - Limited "no data" components
- ⚠️ **Form Validation** - Needs improvement
- ⚠️ **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance not verified

## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **n8n Service** - Deprecated but still in codebase (should be removed)
2. **Firebase vs MongoDB** - Some data duplication between systems
3. **No Unit Tests** - NFR-6.4 requires >70% coverage
4. **No Integration Tests** - Testing strategy not implemented
5. **API Versioning** - Routes not versioned (/api/v1/)
6. **Documentation** - API docs exist but not all endpoints documented

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Remove deprecated n8n service code** to reduce confusion
2. **Implement missing database models** (Waste, Sustainability, Notifications)
3. **Create AI endpoint routes** and connect to Gemini service
4. **Build sustainability scoring algorithm** as core differentiator
5. **Connect frontend dashboard to real backend APIs**

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1. **Complete all FR-3.x** (Material Management) features
2. **Complete all FR-7.x** (Sustainability) features
3. **Implement basic analytics and reporting**
4. **Add push notifications for critical events**
5. **Improve error handling and loading states**

### Long-term Goals (1 month+)
1. **Implement offline-first architecture**
2. **Build comprehensive test suite**
3. **Add performance monitoring**
4. **Implement advanced AI predictions**
5. **Prepare for production deployment**
